WHAT: My attempt at the Bubble Sort project from The Odin Project found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks

FEEDBACK: is encouraged and can be sent to: https://twitter.com/loudmouse312

INSTRUCTIONS:

Part 1: Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).

Part 2: Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block’s return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before – if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is “smaller” than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. Use this to sort your array.

AFTERTHOUGHTS: I had to better understand parallel assignments and the yield keyword for this project.
